						<h3>The Learning Experience Is Fun, Enticing And Trackable</h3>
						<p>Customer service is a fast-paced environment, with every second accounted for. If online training is to be successful, the approach must be results-driven. Gamification provides an appealing proposition for both the employees and the management. While employees get to earn rewards for their participation, team leaders can monitor their performance. They intervene when necessary by offering supplemental support to bridge gaps.

						<h3> Employees See Instant Results From Their Gameplay
</h3>
						<p>You don’t need to wait for the results of an online assessment, or answer a lot of questions, to see how you are progressing in online training. If you get something right, it’s obvious—you move on to the next challenge, reward or level. If you get something wrong, you can try again. This is an important motivator for staff members, providing to-the-minute feedback which can be invaluable in retaining information. No other approach is quite so instantaneous as gamified LMS.

						<h3>Mini-Games </h3>
						<p>Mini-Games Can Be Rolled Out Regularly
						There's no need to focus on providing a full game that replaces a traditional eLearning module. Instead, you can more quickly develop mini-games to provide fast and easy online training on new products, services or processes. These require minimal context and communication for the employee but deliver fast skill training when the time is short, making them the ideal JIT training tool to incorporate into your gamification LMS strategy.

						<h3>Game Mechanics Have A Positive Impact On Behavior Change
</h3>
						<p>By providing a repetitive experience, game mechanics have a proven benefit to retention. If you want to ensure behavior change, you need to build confidence and retrain established ways of operating. Customer service online training gamification provides a real-world space in which to practice new skills or behaviors. Practicing first means customer service staff are more likely to repeat the new behavior once they are back with customers.
</p>

						<h3> Adding A Social Element Through A Gamified LMS
</h3>
						<p>Customer service teams thrive on teamwork and positive collaboration. Social platforms delivered by gamified LMS provide a new opportunity for collaboration and team growth. Encourage customer service employees to chat, search out new information, and complete challenges together. Focusing these collaborative activities on learning provides both better team interaction and better online learning experiences. You can even allow them to share badges to their social media profiles to spark discussion. Not to mention, give them the opportunity to show off their achievements and motivate their peers to reach the next rank.
